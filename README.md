# Sales Performance Follow-Up Intelligence

This portfolio project demonstrates how messy, delayed daily sales submissions
(e.g. WhatsApp messages from field sales reps) can be transformed into
commercial decision-ready insights.

The use case reflects an independent distributor operating inside large
South African retail environments, where real-time POS access is limited.

## Objective
Enable a Commercial Manager to quickly:
- See daily revenue and units sold
- Identify underperforming reps and stores
- Prioritise follow-ups based on real data

## Data
All data used in this project is synthetic and generated to simulate
real-world operational conditions (late submissions, missing data, duplicates).

## Tools
- Python (data parsing & cleaning)
- Power BI (commercial insight dashboard)
- GitHub (version control)

> This project is for portfolio and learning purposes only.

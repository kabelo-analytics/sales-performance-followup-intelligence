# Sales Performance Follow-Up Intelligence

## Context
This project explores sales performance data to identify trends, performance signals, and follow-up opportunities that support business decision-making. The focus is on understanding how sales outcomes evolve over time and where attention or prioritisation may be required.

The analysis is framed from a practical business perspective rather than predictive modelling — answering questions a sales or operations manager would ask when reviewing performance.

## Data & Scope
- Cleaned, structured sales performance dataset
- Focus on descriptive and exploratory analysis
- Initial version (v1) aimed at baseline insights and reporting foundations

## Tools & Workflow
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- KPI calculation and trend analysis
- Jupyter Notebook–based analysis

## Key Insights
- Overall sales trends and performance patterns
- Identification of high- and low-performing segments
- Signals that may inform follow-up actions or prioritisation

## Notes
This repository represents a **version 1 analysis**, focused on exploratory insights and foundational reporting logic.  
Future iterations may include deeper KPI tracking, segmentation, or BI-focused visual dashboards.
